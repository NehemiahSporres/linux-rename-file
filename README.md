To rename a file in Linux, you can use the mv command, which stands for "move." The basic syntax for renaming a file is mv oldname.txt newname.txt, where oldname.txt is the current name of the file you want to rename, and newname.txt is the desired new name. You can also use wildcards and combine mv with other commands like find to rename multiple files at once or rename files based on specific criteria. Additionally, advanced techniques such as regular expressions and bash scripting offer more customization options for file renaming in Linux.

How to Use the Linux mv Command?

Renaming Multiple Files in Linux

So you might ask what command is used to rename a file in Linux when we have multiple files. Renaming multiple files in Linux can be efficiently accomplished using the mv command in combination with various techniques. To rename multiple files simultaneously, you can leverage the power of wildcards, which are symbols representing patterns of characters. For instance, the asterisk * wildcard matches any sequence of characters, while the question mark matches a single character. This enables you to perform batch renaming operations with ease.

For example, for Linux rename file in different directory with the ".txt" extension to have a ".pdf" extension, you can execute the command mv *.txt *.pdf, effectively changing the file extensions for all matching files.

If you need more control over the renaming process, you can use loops or the find Linux rename a file command in combination with mv. A common approach is to use a for loop in a bash script to iterate through a set of files and rename them according to your desired pattern. For instance, you can create a bash script that renames all files in a directory to have a prefix or suffix, adding a timestamp, or any other customized format.

While the `mv` command in Linux is fundamentally designed for moving files from one location to another, it can also be employed to rename files. However, unlike the `rename` command, `mv` doesn't inherently handle batch renaming and requires manual execution for each file or a loop in a shell script.

Renaming files is a very common operation whether you are using the command line or the GUI.

Compared to the GUI (or Graphical User Interface), the CLI is especially powerful. This is in part because you can rename files in bulk or even schedule the scripts to rename files at a certain point in time.
